Originally from Delaware in the USA, I moved to London in September to complete a 12-week
coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). From there, I moved to Dublin, where I worked as a software developer at [Popdeem](http://www.popdeem.com). Now I'm back in the USA, working at [Ardian Group](http://www.ardiangroup.com).
