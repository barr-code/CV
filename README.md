### About Me
___________________
Originally from Delaware in the USA, I moved to London in September to complete a 12-week coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). From there, I moved to Dublin, where I worked as a software developer at [Popdeem](http://www.popdeem.com). Following a brief stint at [Ardian Group](http://www.ardiangroup.com), I am currently working as a Software Consultant at [Solution Street](http://www.solutionstreet.com) in Herndon, VA.

When I'm not coding, you can find me watching Netflix, reading fantasy/fiction, or traipsing through the countryside taking photos.
