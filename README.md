### About Me
___________________
Originally from Delaware in the USA, I moved to London in September to complete a 12-week
coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). From there, I moved to Dublin, where I am currently working as a software developer at [Popdeem](http://www.popdeem.com).

When I'm not coding
(which these days is not often), you can find me watching Netflix, reading fantasy/fiction, or traipsing through
the countryside taking photos.
