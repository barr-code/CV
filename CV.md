### About Me
___________________
Originally from Delaware in the USA, I moved to London in September to complete a 12-week
coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). When I'm not coding 
(which these days is not often), you can find me watching Netflix, reading fantasy/fiction, or traipsing through 
the countryside taking photos.

After I finish at Makers in December, I am looking for a junior developer position
in London, Dublin, New York, or San Francisco.
