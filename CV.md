### About Me
___________________
Originally from Delaware in the USA, I moved to London in September to complete a 12-week
coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). When I'm not coding 
(which these days is not often), you can find me watching Netflix or traipsing through 
the countryside taking photos.

in London, Dublin, New York, or San Francisco.
